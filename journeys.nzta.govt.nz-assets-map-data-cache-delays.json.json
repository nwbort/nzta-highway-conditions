Once all the piles have been driven they will need to be cut to size and the bridge abutments filled with concrete before work to reinstate the bridge deck can begin.</p><p>“We understand that these works are frustrating for local residents and those who travel to the area often, however, our contractors are working as hard as they can to repair the damage as quickly and efficiently as possible,” says Transport Agency Waikato Systems Manager Karen Boyt.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Transport Agency has joined together with Thames Coromandel District Council to provide a free shuttle bus service from Kuaotunu to Whitianga every day while the bridge is closed.</p><p>The Go Kiwi shuttle departs from outside the Kuaotunu fire station, at 7:30am and 8:30am and then returns from Whitianga at 4:30pm and 5:30pm.
